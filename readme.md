Next.js recently introduced the App Router with support for:

- **Layouts:** Easily share UI while preserving state and avoiding re-renders.
- **Server Components:** Making server-first the default for the most dynamic applications.
- **Streaming:** Display instant loading states and stream in updates.
- **Suspense for Data Fetching:** `async`/`await` support and the `use` hook for component-level fetching.
